## What Do GDPR Say About Storing Malicious Domains,IPs?

##### GDPR 

```
How the list of malicious domains and IP addresses is evaluated under the scope of GDPR depends on the nature of the shared data and its intended use. 
If the list of malicious domains and IP addresses does not contain personal data and consists of anonymized or publicly accessible information, 
it may be subject to less stringent regulations under GDPR.

Since it is not based on personal data, its use appears to be legal.
